### Work in progress
**Methane and Markets: Firm Incentives to Emit**, with Toren Fronsdal
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
  As the primary component of natural gas, methane is both a powerful greenhouse gas and a valuable commodity. We explore the economic factors that influence firms' decisions to emit. Using novel data on methane emissions from the Permian Basin, we provide empirical evidence that emissions respond to high-frequency price variation. In particular, emissions are positively correlated with natural gas transport costs, as captured by the Henry-Waha Hub price spread, but have an ambiguous relationship with natural gas prices. To rationalize these patterns, we present a dynamic model in which firms make production and emissions decisions in response to oil and gas prices. We find that, while emissions from natural gas flaring and venting decrease with natural gas prices, overall emissions may increase with gas prices due to the extensive margin production response. With the model, we estimate the impact of methane taxes and policies addressing pipeline capacity.
