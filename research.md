<a href="/pdfs/methane_draft_current.pdf">**Incentives to Emit in Upstream Oil and Gas: Theory, Evidence, and Policy Implications**</a>, with Toren Fronsdal
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
We study how market incentives and infrastructure constraints shape methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We develop a model in which producers choose how many wells to drill and what share of produced gas to market versus emit, and face transmission costs that endogenously depend on pipeline utilization. Leveraging novel satellite data from the Permian Basin, we provide empirical evidence that emissions respond to high-frequency price variation in the ways predicted by our model. We estimate the parameters of our model and use the results to evaluate key policy interventions. A methane tax modeled on the EPA’s proposed Waste Emissions Charge reduces emissions by at least 12 percent when there is no pipeline congestion, but its effectiveness is attenuated when pipelines are congested. Eliminating Texas’ severance tax exemption for vented and flared gas yields modest additional abatement. Although expanding gas pipeline infrastructure may slightly increase drilling, it leads to net emission reductions, particularly during periods of high congestion, and generates private and social returns that substantially exceed construction costs. Combining price-based policies with pipeline capacity investments yields emission reductions greater than the sum of their individual effects.

**Regulating Emissions: The Impact of New Mexico’s Flaring Rules**, with Toren Fronsdal

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
Methane emissions from oil and gas production are a prime target for emissions mitigation efforts worldwide. However, there is limited evidence on which policies are actually effective at reducing methane emissions from this industry.  We evaluate the impact of rules adopted in New Mexico in 2021 that, among other things, impose strict limits on the flaring of natural gas. We compare flaring and methane emissions before and after the policy change to show that the policy had no discernible effect on either outcome. We rationalize this null result using a model of producer decision making from Elhai and Fronsdal (2025), showing that the policy was not accompanied by sufficient enforcement to overcome the private costs of flaring. We quantify the penalties New Mexico would have needed to levy to achieve their flaring reduction targets. We then compare the cost of hitting these targets using penalties versus with Pigouvian taxation.

**Data Centers: Location Choice and Grid Externalities**, with Yixin Zhou

<!--Data centers already account for over 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption (Guidi et al, 2024), and this total is forecast to increase as more facilities continue to be built. Because of both the scale and concentration of their energy demands, data centers can reshape entire electricity markets. Until now, we have not understood exactly what the consequences of this growth are for either utilities or consumers. In this project, we use a combination of event studies around data center opening dates and constructed marginal dispatch cost curves to examine how data centers impact utility prices and costs. We find that these impacts vary significantly by geography due to differences in generation fuel mix and interconnections, creating large disparities in the welfare cost of data centers across space. We build and calibrate a model of the data center location decision in order to estimate the welfare costs of different policies that impact these decisions. Policies we study include direct subsidies, grid enhancement, zoning changes, and renewable generation subsidies.-->
