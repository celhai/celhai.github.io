**Methane and Markets: Firm Incentives to Emit**, with Toren Fronsdal
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
As the primary component of natural gas, methane is both a powerful greenhouse gas and a valuable commodity. We explore the economic factors that influence firms' decisions to emit. Using novel data on methane emissions from the Permian Basin, we provide empirical evidence that emissions respond to high-frequency price variation. In particular, emissions are positively correlated with natural gas transport costs, as captured by the Henry-Waha Hub price spread, but have an ambiguous relationship with natural gas prices. To rationalize these patterns, we present a dynamic model in which firms make production and emissions decisions in response to oil and gas prices. We find that, while emissions from natural gas flaring and venting decrease with natural gas prices, overall emissions may increase with gas prices due to the extensive margin production response. In practice, however, we find that Permian gas production responds primarily to oil prices, not gas prices. We conclude that adding gas transmission capacity can be an effective way to reduce methane emissions from jointly produced oil and gas.

**Data Centers: Location Choice and Grid Externalities**, with Yixin Zhou

<!--Data centers already account for over 4% of total U.S. electricity consumption (Guidi et al, 2024), and this total is forecast to increase as more facilities continue to be built. Because of both the scale and concentration of their energy demands, data centers can reshape entire electricity markets. Until now, we have not understood exactly what the consequences of this growth are for either utilities or consumers. In this project, we use a combination of event studies around data center opening dates and constructed marginal dispatch cost curves to examine how data centers impact utility prices and costs. We find that these impacts vary significantly by geography due to differences in generation fuel mix and interconnections, creating large disparities in the welfare cost of data centers across space. We build and calibrate a model of the data center location decision in order to estimate the welfare costs of different policies that impact these decisions. Policies we study include direct subsidies, grid enhancement, zoning changes, and renewable generation subsidies.-->
