### Work in progress
**Methane and Markets: Firm Incentives to Emit**, with Toren Fronsdal
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
  As the primary component of natural gas, methane is both a powerful greenhouse gas and a valuable commodity. We explore the economic factors that influence firms' decisions to emit rather than to sell the gas that they produce. Using novel data on methane emissions from the Permian Basin, we provide empirical evidence that firms do not reduce emissions when the gas price they face goes up, as a simple economic model would suggest. Instead, firm emissions decisions are shaped by the joint nature of oil and gas production, as well as binding capacity constraints in natural gas processing and pipelines. We present a static model of natural gas production and emissions and a dynamic model of pipeline investment. We will employ these models to assess the emissions impacts of a broad range of policies, such as incentivizing pipeline construction and tying new well permits to available pipeline capacity. We plan to compare the efficacy of these policies to the traditional emission-reducing tools of fees and monitoring.
