**Methane and Markets: Firm Incentives to Emit**, with Toren Fronsdal
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  
  As the primary component of natural gas, methane is both a powerful greenhouse gas and a valuable commodity. We explore the economic factors that influence firms' decisions to emit rather than to sell the gas that they produce. Using novel data on methane emissions from the Permian Basin, we provide empirical evidence that emissions respond to high-frequency price variation. In particular, emissions are positively correlated with capacity constraints in natural gas processing and pipelines, as captured by the Henry-Waha Hub price spread. To rationalize these dynamics, we present a model of the natural gas industry in which firms make production and emissions decisions in response to oil and gas prices, as well as the cost of capturing and transporting gas. The model implies a substantial social cost to insufficient processing and transmission capacity.
